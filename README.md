Visualizing the Smart Lumber problem

**IF YOU ARE CURRENTLY ENROLLED IN HARVEY MUDD'S CS 140 CLASS,
 LOOKING AT THE SOURCE CODE FOR THE SOLUTION FOR THE SMART LUMBER
 PROBLEM IS AN ACADEMIC INTEGRITY VIOLATION** 

Requirements: 
Must have python3 and qtpy installed. 

Build: `make` to build from makefile. If building from the makefile parallel table filling may not occur
Alternatively build using cmake. 

Run:
`python main.py`

Highly recommend making an art directory called `art` to store art and adding `art/` in filename
